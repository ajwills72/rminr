cpsdata <- read_csv(url("http://www.willslab.org.uk/cps2.csv"))
cpslow <- cpsdata %>% filter(income < 150000)
```

In the [Evidence](evidence.html) worksheet, we did the following Bayesian t-test:

```{r bfttest}
ttestBF(formula = income ~ sex, data = data.frame(cpsdata))
```

Here's a more detailed explanation of the output of that test -- we'll go through each bit in turn:

`Bayes factor analysis` - You're doing a Bayes Factor analysis.

`[1] Alt., r=0.707` - In order to calculate a Bayes Factor, R has to make some assumptions about how big the difference is likely to be. The `ttestBF` command makes some broad assumptions that cover the range of effect sizes typically seen in psychology. 

More specifically, `ttestBF` assumes a Cauchy distribution of effect sizes centered on zero, with a scale of 0.707 -- this is where `r=0.707` comes from. That description probably didn't make much sense useless you have a very strong maths background, so here's the same idea, shown as a density plot. It's basically an assumption that small effect sizes are quite likely, and large effect sizes are quite unlikely.

```{r cauchy, echo=FALSE}
x<-seq(-10,10,by=0.1)
plot(x, dcauchy(x, scale = .707),type="l", xlab = "Effect size", ylab = "")
```

`18.25128` - The Bayes Factor (i.e. the main result of this analysis)

`±0%` - Basically a confidence interval on the Bayes Factor. It's 0% here because we have so much data, but with smaller samples we might see something like `20 ±5%`, which would means the Bayes Factor is about 20, give or take 5%. So, it's between 19 and 21.

`Against denominator:` - This tells you that the null hypothesis is the denominator of the fraction that is used to calculate the Bayes Factor. So, in other words, you're getting BF~10~ rather than BF~01~ -- see the [Evidence](evidence.html) worksheet.

`Null, mu1-mu2 = 0` - This tells you that the null hypothesis is that the difference between the two group means (called `mu1` and `mu2` here) is zero. 

`Bayes factor type: BFindepSample` - You're doing a Bayes Factor analysis; `indepSample` is short for `independent samples`, which is another way of saying "between-subjects test". `JZS` is short for Jeffreys, Zellner, and Siow - the surnames of three people who are credited with coming up with this particular way of working out Bayes Factors.

## When p-values and Bayes Factors disagree

So, what if your p-value is less than .05, but your Bayes Factor is less than 3? The short answer is ... 
believe the Bayes Factor, and ignore the p value. The p value is there for historical reasons and doesn't tell you anything you actually want to know. 

### Long answer

Recall that the p value doesn't tell you anything that is both easy to
understand and useful to know. For example, it *doesn't* tell you the
likelihood of the null hypothesis, given your data.

Recall also that BF does give you something you want to know --- how much more
likely your experimental hypothesis is than the null hypothesis (e.g. BF = 3 means
experimental hypothesis is 3x more likely)

Now, take a look at [Wetzels et al. (2011)](http://pcl.missouri.edu/sites/default/files/Wetzels:etal:2011.pdf). In situations where .01 < p < .05,
most of the time Bayesian analysis indicates the evidence is
anecdotal (i.e. BF < 3). If you were going to stick to p values, you wouldn't
pick the p <.05 threshold -- it's just far too lenient.

Then, take a look at [Masicampo & Lalande (2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Lalande/publication/230594320_A_Peculiar_Prevalence_of_p_Values_Just_Below_05/links/55f97a1408aeafc8ac259527/A-Peculiar-Prevalence-of-p-Values-Just-Below-05.pdf?origin=publication_detail) ... p values in Psychology are
very  commonly in the .01 < p <.05 region.

Put that all together and we begin to get a sense of one of the causes of the
replication crisis, and how BF may help us escape it.
