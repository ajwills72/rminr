Means and medians

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 50)
```

Median
======

```{r}
data
```

- The median is the middle number when the data is put in order

```{r}
median(data)
```

Mean
====

```{r}
data
```

- The mean is the sum of all the numbers (72), divided by the sample size (9), giving:

```{r}
mean(data)
```

Comparison
=====

```{r}
data
```

- In this case, the mean (8) is bigger than nearly all the numbers. This means it's not very _representative_ of its sample.

- The mean will always be unrepresentative when there are a few numbers that are very high (or very low), compared to the rest.

- In these cases, we sau the distibution is _skewed_.

Skewness
====

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
cpsdata <- read_csv("http://www.willslab.org.uk/cps2.csv")
cpsdata %>% ggplot(aes(income)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=20000)
```

- Our _income_ data is skewed, so the median gives a better indication of average salary than the mean in this case.
