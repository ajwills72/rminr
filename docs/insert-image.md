# Making Reports in R
_Andy Wills_

## Wordprocessors

_Don't_ screenshot or cut-and-paste graphs from RStudio Online into your wordprocessor, because the end result looks very unprofessional. If you're using a wordprocessor to write a report, do this instead:

1. Export your graph, using the _Export_ icon on RStudio's _Plots_ window, and selecting "Save as image...". Give it a meaninful file name (e.g. "dom-scatter") and click 'Save'. 

2. Click on the 'Files' tab in RStudio Online, and click the tick box to select your file (it will have whatever filename you just gave it.). 

3. Click on "More" (next to the little blue gear wheel), and then "Export...". 

4. Click "Download". The file will now be in the Downloads folder of your computer. 

5. Now, you can insert the downloaded image file into your wordprocessor document -- see this [how-to](https://libreofficehelp.com/how-insert-and-use-images-in-libreoffice-writer/) for LibreOffice, or this [video tutorial](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Insert-pictures-3C51EDF4-22E1-460A-B372-9329A8724344) for Word.

## RMarkdown

Alternatively, you can make reports with RStudio. This has many advantages over using a wordprocessor such as Word, or LibreOffice, but we don't cover it in this introductory course.
