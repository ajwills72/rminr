This is a crowd-sourced list of organizations using R to teach research methods in Psychology,

was adopted at undergraduate and postgraduate level is also recorded.

If you'd like to add to this list, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ajwills72/rminr/blob/master/docs/rminrinpsy.md). Or, if you're not 
sure how to do that, just email me: andy@willslab.co.uk
