# Teaching Research Methods in R

This is a crowd-sourced list of uses of R to teach research methods _in Psychology_,
and a link to Creative Commons teaching materials, where these are available. The year teaching in R
was adopted at undergraduate and postgraduate level is also recorded, where known. Where there are no materials, but the  organization's name has a link, this is a link to evidence that R is used.

If you'd like to add to this list, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ajwills72/rminr/blob/master/docs/rminrinpsy.md). Or, if you're not 
sure how to do that, just email me: andy@willslab.co.uk
