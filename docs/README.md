## Putting R to work

These are mainly further practice in the skills you learned in _Absolute Beginners'_. Where the exercises contain completely new skills, these are shown in **bold**. Where the excercises extend a skill you've already been taught, these are shown in _italics_. The exercises are somewhat graded in difficulty, with Part 1 being the easiest and Part 3 containing some harder exercises. 

If you are a current undergraduate student at Plymouth University, you should complete the accompanying Psych:EL (Psychology: Experiential Learning) activity first, in order to generate your own set of data. If you're not, you can download sample data files [here](rtoworkdata.html).

#### Part 1a

* [Autobiographical memory study](memories.html). Entering data by hand, _histograms_.

* [Face recognition experiment](face-recog.html). Means, _filtering data_, and a **bar graph**.

* [Spatial navigation tests](navigate.html). More on **bar graphs**.

#### Part 1b

* [Response compatibility experiment](response-compatibility.html). Means, filtering data, standard deviations, and density plots.

* [Visual illusions](illusions.html). Filtering data, means, **violin plot**, Bayesian t-test.

#### Part 2

* [Facial attractiveness experiment](face-attract.html). Means, standard deivations, **inter-quartile range**, and _density plots_. 

#### Part 3

* [Animal Behaviour](lions.html). Percentage agreement, Cohen's kappa, contingency tables, _bar charts_.

* [Brexit personalities](brexit.html). Means, filtering data, _summarising data_, density plots, effect size, Bayesian t-test, traditional t-test. 

* [Creativity and the environment](green.html). **Preprocessing**, means, density plots, effect size, Bayesian t-test.

* [Police lineup](lineup.html). Contingency table, mosaic plot, Bayesian contingency test, means, density plot, Bayesian t-test
