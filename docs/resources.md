# Further reading
_Andy Wills_

_Research Methods in R_ is deliberately introductory, only scratching the surface of what can be achieved in R. Below is a list of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) resources that [respect your freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) -- in other words resources that are, and always will be, free.

Alternatively, there are some video tutorials about R on [lynda.com](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/about-us/university-structure/service-areas/it-services/lynda). Students at some universities have paid for access to these materials through their tuition fees. Unfortunately, once they graduate, they lose access to these materials unless they pay [Â£180 per  year](https://techboomers.com/t/lynda-cost) to lynda.com. I recommend sticking to the freedom-respecting resources I list below.

## General guides

[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 
- The definitive guide to modern R usage, but it's one of the more advanced guides out there. Co-written by Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio, and author of much of the _tidyverse_. _CC BY-NC-ND_. 

## Graphs

[R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)
- More graph recipes, focussing on particularly beautiful ones.

[ggplot2 extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/index.html).

[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](ggplot2-book.pdf)
- The definitive guide to making graphs with R, one of the more advanced guides out there. Written by Hadley Wickham. The source code for this book, from which this PDF was created, is freely available on [github](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book).
