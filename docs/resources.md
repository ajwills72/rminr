# Further reading

_Research Methods in R_ is deliberately introductory, only scratching the surface of what can be achieved in R. Below is a list of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) resources that [respect your freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) -- in other words resources that are, and always will be, free.

Alternatively, there are some video tutorials about R on [lynda.com](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/about-us/university-structure/service-areas/it-services/lynda). Students at some universities have paid for access to these materials through their tuition fees. Unfortunately, once they graduate, they lose access to these materials unless they pay [£180 per  year](https://techboomers.com/t/lynda-cost) to lynda.com. I recommend sticking to the freedom-respecting resources I list below.
