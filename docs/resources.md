_Research Methods in R_ is deliberately introductory, only scratching the surface of what can be achieved in R. Below is a list of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) resources that [respect your freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) -- in other words resources that are, and always will be, free.

[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 
- The definitive guide to modern R usage, but it's one of the more advanced guides out there. Co-written by Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio, and author of much of the _tidyverse_. _CC BY-NC-ND_. 

[Other courses](rminrinpsy.html) 
- A list of organizations using R to teach research methods in psychology, with links to their materials. 

## Graphs

[psyntur](https://github.com/mark-andrews/psyntur) - An R package by Mark Andrews at Nottingham Trent University, the largest UK psychology course using R. This package provides commands for common graph types that are less flexible than ggplot, but easier to use for beginners.

[Cookbook for R: Graphs](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
- Recipes for common graph types in R. Written by Winston Chang, former Psychology graduate student and now a programmer at RStudio. _CC-BY-SA_

[R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)
- More graph recipes, focussing on particularly beautiful ones.

[ggplot2 extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/index.html). 
- This website provides links to many R packages that allow you to do more types of graphs in R.

[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](ggplot2-book.pdf)
- The definitive guide to making graphs with R, one of the more advanced guides out there. Written by Hadley Wickham. The source code for this book, from which this PDF was created, is freely available on [github](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book). You can buy an paper or ebook version through an online book retailer.
